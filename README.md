# QuangThinhBDS

This project is a rent realestate platform application that uses [OpenZepplin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity).

The contract is compiled and deployed under the ERC-721 non-fungible token standard with hardhat framework. After deploying onto the Ethereum blockchain, users will be able to use this application by interacting with the smart contract through DAPPâ€™s front-end interface.

# ERC-721 Token

ERC-721 non-fungible token:
ERC-721 is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique (with unique ID).
